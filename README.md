## KaggleX Cohort 3 Project: Immigration to Canada - Exploratory Data Analysis

The project involved conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the "Immigration to Canada" dataset available on Kaggle.

This dataset encompassed immigration records from over 150 countries to Canada, spanning the years from 1980 to 2013. During the analysis, various data science topics were applied, including the examination of trends and patterns within the dataset, the utilization of data visualization techniques using tools such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Wordcloud to provide insightful representations, and the implementation of linear regression models for predictive purposes.

The project aimed to uncover valuable insights and trends related to immigration to Canada during the specified time frame, providing a deeper understanding of the factors influencing immigration patterns and their potential impact on various socio-economic aspects.
